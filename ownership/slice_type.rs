  let mut s = String::from("hello world");
  let word = first_word(&s); // word will get the value 5
  s.clear(); // this empties the String, making it equal to ""
  /* word still has the value 5 here, but there's no more string that
    we could meaningfully use the value 5 with. word is now totally invalid!
  */
  /* More concerningly this would compile because word isn't meaninfully connnected
    so the compiler cannot guard against this; it also makes it very brittle because
    we have to keep track of it in weird ways.

    This gets even worse with a second word function that would look like:
          fn second_word(s: &String) -> (usize, usize){
    There is would be three chunks of related but not connected data that would have to be tracked
    this is super brittle and error prone

  let hello = &s2[0..5];
  // this is a slice of the string s that starts at the 6th byte and ends at the 11th byte

  // this instead can also return on string slice. This is much more flexible and less brittle/error prone

    this API it much better because it is harder to make mistakes as it needs to ensure it is valid for the 
    underlying string; just by using a slice it is impossible to get the error from before.
    This is because clear requires a mutable reference and because the slice is borrowing a immutable reference
    these things cannot exist at the same time when the immutable reference is used in a print statement but the 
    string is cleared aka mutable/mutated.
