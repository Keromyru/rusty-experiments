/*
  Rust has an extremely powerful control flow operator called match that allows comparison of a value
  against a series of patterns and then executes code based on which pattern matches. 
  Patterns can be:
    - literals
    - variable names
    - wildcards
    - many other things
  The power is from the expressiveness of hte matching and that the compiler will ensure that all cases
  are handled.

  another useful feature of match is that they can bind to the parts of the values that match the pattern.
  this is how extraction from enum variants can be done by adding another emum with the states the 
  coins were produced in.
  this way lets it return what state the quarter is from if it matches that arm of the match expression

Recall the Coin enum definition in Listing 6-4, where the Quarter variant also held a UsState value.
