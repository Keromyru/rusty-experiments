// To compile rust code:
rustc ./main.rs OR rustc main.rs

// to run rust file
./main  OR .\main.exe

// this outputs a binary executable! :)
// .exe or just the compiled file will be there alongside a .pdb of debuff information
// these are single files to create a new project:

cargo new <projectName>
//this also created a .toml file as well as a /src directory
// the .toml is a config for cargo; also crates refer to packages! lol

// to build a cargo project
cargo build
// this creates a target folder with a bug folder 
// (the default build is a bug build)
// to run the debug project
./target/debug/hello_cargo or .\target\debug\hello_cargo.exe

cargo run //will build and run the project for us! no more dual steps
// if source code does not change it just runs the current executable
//otherwise we would see the coSmplier working

// neat tool is 
cargo check
// this ensures the project will compile and is much faster than build
// essentially check it will still run then build once ready to use the executable

cargo build --release // does some optimizations and will put the executable in target/release
// this does slow down the compile time btw

//note that cargo .toml has semantic verisoning so a verision 0.8.5 will take any version\
// higher that 0.8.5 but below 0.9.0
// also note to update anything
cargo update
// can be used to increase the version, like to 0.8.6 but NOT to 0.9.0 
// explicit updates, things with potentially breaking changes
// need to be updated manually in the .toml file
